# !DEPRECATED!: UI Logs

Custom panel that show colorful logs for Home Assistant (core), and the supervisor (if you have it).

_Probably super useless, but whatever..._
![demo](https://github.com/custom-components/uilogs/raw/master/demo.gif)

## Configuration

```yaml
uilogs:
```

When downloaded and configured, look for a new "Logs" entry in your sidebar.

_no options, just add it._
